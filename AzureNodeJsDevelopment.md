# Azure Node.JS Development

## Azure CLI Tool
Before getting started, you should install the Azure CLI Tool. You can download the executable from the link below : 

[Azure CLI Tools Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

Once you have installed the CLI tools you, can then run the following command in the command prompt:  `az` as this will list all of the available commands that you can run. 

### Login
Before running most commands you must login to Azure. You can do this by running the: `az login ` command. 

If you are running on windows you can use the windows credential manager to store and retrieve your credentials without having to re-enter them everytime.
